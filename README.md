I'm using LibreOffice so closed source can't peddle my writing to some Butlerin proscribed entity.  
Sometimes when I write I forgor (when I last)/(how frequently) I use a term、 punctuation mark、 etc... and I want to avoid repetition and genericism.  
So I search for that term、 punctuation mark、 etc... and see if (the last usage is too proximate to my new intended site)/(it is generally overused).
However, LibreOffice (AFAIK, gave up after a DuckDuckGo search) doesn't display all occurrences of a search term across the span of a document, such as how chrome does along the scrollbar (example pic below)
This tool (will) show[s] the occurrences of a search term per chapter
